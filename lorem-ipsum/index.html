<h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>

<h2>History</h2>

<p><a href="https://loremipsum.io/">Lorem ipsum</a>, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the <strong>15th</strong> century who is thought to have scrambled parts of <em>Cicero&#39;s De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</em> for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Digital Ipsum</h2>

<p>The decade that brought us Star Trek and Doctor Who also resurrected Cicero—or at least what used to be Cicero—in an attempt to make the days before computerized design a little less painstaking.</p>

<p>The French lettering company Letraset manufactured a set of dry-transfer sheets which included the lorem ipsum filler text in a variety of fonts, sizes, and layouts. These sheets of lettering could be rubbed on anywhere and were quickly adopted by graphic artists, printers, architects, and advertisers for their professional look and ease of use. </p>

<h2>Design or (Dis)content</h2>

<p>Among design professionals, there&#39;s a bit of controversy surrounding the filler text. Controversy, as in Death to Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p>The strength of lorem ipsum is its weakness: it doesn&#39;t communicate. To some, designing a website around placeholder text is unacceptable, akin to sewing a custom suit without taking measurements. Kristina Halvorson notes: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve heard the argument that “lorem ipsum” is effective in wireframing or design because it helps people focus on the actual layout, or color scheme, or whatever. What kills me here is that we’re talking about creating a user experience that will (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The entire structure of the page or app flow is FOR THE WORDS.” </p>
